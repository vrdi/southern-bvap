## State Laws

Comprehensive writeup for each state's redistricting rules [can be found here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aJmJ_u3CV50kMVMtmDcI9op_Zsq1k4dLLo6pYbaa1uw/edit).

### Alabama [[source]](http://www.legislature.state.al.us/aliswww/reapportionment/Reapportionment%20Guidelines%20for%20Redistricting.pdf)
* Congressional district populations must be "as nearly equal in population as practicable."
* State legislative districts must not deviate by more than 2%.
* Must prioritize "race-neutral criteria" over "consideriations that stereotype voters on the basis of race, color, or membership in a language-minority group."
* Must be "contiguous and reasonably compact".
* Each district composed of "as few counties as practicable."
* Contiguity by water is allowed.
* Communities of interest must be respected.

### Arkansas [[source]](http://www.arkansasredistricting.org/article-8)
* Congressional district populations must deviate by no more than 1%; state legislative districts by 10%.
* State legislative districts must follow county lines except where otherwise legally impossible. (No such requirement for Congressional districts.)
* Must minimize political subdivisions.
* Must maintain communities of interest.
* Squares and circles preferable; deviation from these shapes increases chance that the district will be thrown out.

### Georgia [[source]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/2egd5vpo0djzqt5/GeorgiaHouseCommitteeGuidelines2011-12.pdf)
* Congressional districts must deviate by no more than one person.
* State legislative districts should "achieve a total population that is substantially equal as pacticable..."
* Single-point (queen) contiguity not allowed.

### Louisiana [[source]](http://house.louisiana.gov/h_redistricting2011/2011_H&GA_REAPP%20RULES_ADOPTED.pdf)
* Congressional districts must have "a population as nearly equal to the ideal district population as practicable."
* All redistricting plans must contain "whole election precincts."

### Mississippi [[source]](https://www.dropbox.com/s/z36sc17c3m1cewv/MississippiLegislativeAndCongressionalRedistrictingCommitteeMinutes2012-04-05.pdf)
* No rules other than federally mandated rules and laws.

### South Carolina [[source]](http://redistricting.schouse.gov/6334-1500-2011-Redistricting-Guidelines-(A0404871).pdf)
* Congressional district ideal population is 660,766; plans must "produce the lowest overall range of deviation possible when taking into consideration geographic limitations."
* State House ideal population is 37,301. No deviation more than 5% (federal standard).
* Communities of interest must be respected.

### Tennessee [[source]](https://advance.lexis.com/documentpage/?pdmfid=1000516&crid=52a2d157-6b41-4f61-8774-bb258bac8500&nodeid=AADAABAABAAC&nodepath=%2fROOT%2fAAD%2fAADAAB%2fAADAABAAB%2fAADAABAABAAC&title=3-1-102.+Composition+of+state+senatorial+districts.&config=025054JABlOTJjNmIyNi0wYjI0LTRjZGEtYWE5ZC0zNGFhOWNhMjFlNDgKAFBvZENhdGFsb2cDFQ14bX2GfyBTaI9WcPX5&pddocfullpath=%2fshared%2fdocument%2fstatutes-legislation%2furn%3acontentItem%3a4X8J-6SH0-R03N-6340-00008-00&ecomp=g37_kkk&prid=fb0c9dd9-aeb8-45d1-be46-126cc5b507d9)
